MIMO LTI system identification by active set methods

Low-order systems are identified given time and/or frequency response information through the use of an L1/Linf-based grouping penalty. The Randomize phase adds new candidate atoms into the system, and the Reweight phase sparsifies the selection of atoms while monotonically decreasing fitting error. Consult `mimo/README.md` for further information.
